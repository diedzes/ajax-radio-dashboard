# Ajax Radio Dashboard

Simple React dashboard for analyzing Ajax Radio matchday data.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy JSON data files to public directory:
```bash
cp ../output/*.json public/output/
```

3. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The dashboard will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Build

To build for production:
```bash

```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Data Files

The dashboard expects the following JSON files in `public/output/`:

These files are generated by the `analyze_matchdays.py` script.
